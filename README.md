# GitHub Actions Workflow Tutorial by Abhijeet

Welcome to the GitHub Actions Workflow Tutorial by AbhijeetGithu ! This guide will help you understand the basics of creating and using workflows to automate your software development processes using GitHub Actions.

## What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation platform provided by GitHub. It allows you to define custom workflows to automate various tasks within your repository, such as building, testing, deploying, and more.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a Workflow File:**
   Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository. This is where you'll store your workflow configuration files in YAML format.

2. **Define a Workflow:**
   Inside the `.github/workflows` directory, create a new YAML file (e.g., `my-workflow.yml`). Define your workflow using the GitHub Actions syntax. You can set up triggers, jobs, steps, and use predefined or custom actions.

3. **Workflow Syntax:**
   A basic workflow includes "on" events that trigger the workflow, followed by a set of "jobs" that contain the tasks you want to automate. Each job consists of "steps" that define individual actions.

4. **Using Actions:**
   Actions are reusable units of code that can be executed in your workflows. GitHub provides a variety of predefined actions, and you can also create your own custom actions.

5. **Secrets and Environment Variables:**
   Use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive information like API keys, tokens, and passwords securely. You can then access these secrets in your workflows.

6. **Workflow Examples:**
   Explore GitHub's official actions marketplace and documentation for various examples and use cases. Tailor these examples to your specific needs.

## Workflow Example

Here's a simple example of a workflow that builds and tests a project on every push to the `main` branch:

```yaml
name: Build and Test

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: 14

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
